#   reading in 001-332 .csv files with data and performing some simple stat summaries
#
#
#   example line below reads in the 5th csv file into a data frame with names of Date sulfate nitrate ID
#               Date            sulfate  nitrate   ID
#               2003-01-01      NA       NA         5

# ex5 <- read.table("005.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

#  code will need to concatenate 0 or 00 to the loop variable used to sequence thru the requested input files
#  based on the value of i.  like:  If i < 9 then fn = concat("00"&i&".csv") else if i < 99 
#    fn = concat("0"&i&".csv") else fn=concat(i&".csv").  Readtable statement in loop is read.table(fn,header=True,Sep=",")
#  
#   Need to find code which concatenates files read into same data frame.  
#     files <- list.files(pattern = "\\.csv$")

#  #temperary data frame to load the contents on the current file
#  temp_df <- data.frame(ModelName = character(), Object = character(),stringsAsFactors = F)
#
#  #reading each file within the range and append them to create one file
#  for (i in 1:length(files)){
#   #read the file
#    currentFile = read.csv(files[i])
#
#     #Append the current file
#   temp_df = rbind(temp_df, currentFile)    
# }
#  
#   Use mean(x,na.rm=TRUE) to get the mean

# Why doesn't the line above work.  the Error message '\U' used without hex digits ...  That means nothing and 
# now is consuming time to figure out little syntax crap instead of progressing with this course
# Need to have a different approach when just turning over a little instruction into go program this 
# and knowing \\ instead of \, it seems that is a very common issue but required too much effort to find out
# the simple instruction was not taken.  R was written for unix ? - may need to keep that in mind....
